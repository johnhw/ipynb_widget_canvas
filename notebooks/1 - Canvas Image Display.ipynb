      "The [Interactive Widgets](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Interactive%20Widgets/Index.ipynb) for the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/notebook/index.html) are now a reality and I cannot say enough nice things about them.  There is so much potential for doing interesting work using this set of tools.  I thought it would be a great learning experience for me to build a quantitative image viewing/analysis tool using these new widgets.  It turns out the IPython Notebook built-in image widget is based on an `<img>` element and is rather simple.  I decided that the first step on my new project would be to build a better image-display widget based on the awesome HTML5 Canvas Element.  The people at Mozilla have a nice [description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) of the `Canvas` that is worth reading.  Essentially, the Canvas Element is a great tool for displaying images and drawing artwork onto a bitmap surface.  It has built-in support for size and rotation transforms, and good number of third-party JavaScript libraries have sprung up adding all kinds of amazing feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `Canvas Element` can do a lot more than just display an image.  It has a bunch of methods for drawing all kinds of lines and shapes!  Right now I'm completely focused on displaying and working with images, but still I wrote the Canvas Widget generic enough such that adding additional draw functions should be a rather straightforward task.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many options to choose from when using the Canvas to [display an image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial/Using_images).  It pretty much comes down to specifying a  source of image data when calling `canvas.drawImage(some_image_data)`.  The [Canvas Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial/Using_images#Getting_images_to_draw) at the Mozilla Developer Network site has a good summary about which data types the Ccanvas is able to use as an image source:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **[HTMLImageElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement)**: These are images created using the `Image()` constructor, as well as any existing [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **[HTMLVideoElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement)**: Using an HTML [Video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element as a source grabs the current frame from the video as the image.\n",

      "- **[HTMLCanvasElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement)**: Another [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element as a source.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest option for me was to constrct an internal `Image` element from the user-supplied `src` string.  Just below is an example showing exactly how I did that."

      "I have a few thoughts about my base class `CanvasWidget` and the derived class `ImageWidget`.  I envision that the `CanvasWidget` is close in spirit to the HTML5 `Canvas Element`.  Any basic characteristic or functionality found in the Canvas Element should be matched with an equivalant feature in the my `CanvasWidget` class.  For example, the `Canvas Element` supports basic image display and shape drawing functions, plus it also generates it's own events in response to the user's mouse or keyboard interactions.  My `CanvasWidget` is where these features exist now, or hopefully will in the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "Speaking of the future, currently `CanvasWidget` does not support drawing geometric shapes, but I'm certain it could be done without too much effort.  My focus now is with image display, but that doesn't prevent anyone else from lending a hand and working out details for line and shape drawing. The next step for me with `CanvasWidget` will be to add basic support for mouse and keyboard events such that the user will be able to attach their own Python event handlers.  I also want to support image [transforms](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#transformations).  The next steps for `ImageWidget` will be to provide helper functions making it easy to connect mouse/keyboard events with generating new image transforms.  This combination will enable even more features like image panning with the mouse or zooming with the scroll wheel.  \n",
