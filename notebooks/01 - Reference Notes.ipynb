    "## HTML Canvas Element\n",
    "\n",
    "The Canvas Element is a great tool for displaying images and drawing artwork onto a bitmap surface.  It has built-in support for size and rotation transforms, and good number of third-party JavaScript libraries have sprung up adding all kinds of amazing feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The people at Mozilla have a nice [description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) of the Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comprehensive Canvas reference at [whatwg.org](http://whatwg.org) specifically for developers: [The Canvas Element](http://developers.whatwg.org/the-canvas-element.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Canvas to [display an image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial/Using_images).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Canvas Element height and width properties were initially quite confusing for me.  That's because its a two-part problem! 1) the Canvas has an inherent width and height measured in data pixels; 2) the Canvas as displayed to the screen is controlled by the element's CSS width and height. The StackOverflow discussion [canvas-width-and-height-in-html5](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4938346/canvas-width-and-height-in-html5) was extremely helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- More on Canvas width and height: I found I could not rely on the style width and height to always default to the Canvas' inherent width and height properties after several changes. Maybe I did something wrong?  Maybe something to do with the IPython Notebook environment?  I don't know.  My solution was to explicitly set the Canvas style width and height whenever I needed to modify the Canvas' inherent width and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here's a great description of the [order of events](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-2dcontext-20140821/#drawing-images-to-the-canvas) when drawing an image to the canvas."

Also check out [ipython-widgetboilerplate](https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython-widgetboilerplate) for a comprehensive example on setting up a new widget project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The built-in IPython parent widget class `DOMWidget` has methods for handling CSS styles.  Use those methods instead of building custom handlers for particular style properties, e.g. border thickness and color.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook about IPython's [Traitlet Events](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Interactive%20Widgets/Widget%20Events.ipynb#Traitlet-Events) gives a lot of insight into the relationship between front-end widgets and back-end data structures.  IPython's built-in widgets generally connect a simple data type (an integer or float, a list of values, etc.) to a simple widget (slider, checkbox, dropdown list).  This explains why most built-in widgets focus on synchronizing a `value` property between Python and JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The built-in button widget is a departure from the above pattern.  It doesn't manage any data, instead it's internal framework is adapted to manage custom `click` events generated by the frontend.\n",

    "- In my application I don't have a clean correspondence between a Python back-end variable and a simple HTML5/JavaScript front-end widget, which is how the IPython built-in widgets are designed.  Instead I have an image and related cropping/scaling and offset parameters. I don't want to perform extra work and update all widget parameters when a single model parameter is changed. Some update are low overhead, e.g. redraw the image, while others require a lot of work, e.g. receive new PNG-compressed image data and copy it into the internal `Image` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best solution I've found to date is to forgo performing any work in my Backbone View's `this.update()` method, and instead use separate event handlers for each major part of my model.  These can be defined in `this.initialize()` and it might look like this:\n",
