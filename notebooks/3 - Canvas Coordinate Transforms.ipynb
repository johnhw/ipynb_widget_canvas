      "## To Do:\n",
      "- Review and test updates to Transform callback function.\n",
      "- Incorporate Pan_Zoom_Rotate examples.\n",
      "- Support changing `imageSmoothing` option on canvas.\n",
      "- Transfer prototype Notebook code for handling/generating Transform events into a proper Python module.  Place into own module, or perhaps inside of existing Transform.py.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Check for mouse leave/enter canvas for more robust drag event handling / responsiveness\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ideas for interactive drag & resize:\n",
      "    - Look into resizable canvas by click/dragging edge or corner\n",
      "    - [canvas resize](http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-drag-and-drop-resize-and-invert-images)\n",
      "    - Possible ideas at [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1977741/resizable-canvas-jquery-ui)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Build draft version of my Quiver app.\n",
      "\n",
      "## To Do Later:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reduce latencies in mouse/transform responsiveness:\n",
      "    - Look for areas to eliminate redundancies.\n",
      "    - Move more code from Python back-end to JavaScript front-end.  I suspect the major source of latency is the round-trip between back-end and front-end while responding to user input mouse events.\n",
      "    - The following bits of code will be useful when moving stsuff to the front-end:\n",
      "        - Blog post: http://simonsarris.com/blog/471-a-transformation-class-for-canvas-to-keep-track-of-the-transformation-matrix\n",
      "        - Github repo: https://github.com/simonsarris/Canvas-tutorials/blob/master/transform.js\n",
      "        - Grab a `decompose()` function from here: https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/blob/master/src/basic/Matrix.js\n",
      "\n",
      "## Done:\n",
      "- Transform to be implemented in parts.  Six-element vector of the numbers making up the transform matrix will be basic data synced between front- and bak-ends.- Examples maniplating image with transforms\n",
      "- Example with dispaying mouse motion & click event info via Text Widget\n",
      "- Initialize Python class, with or without an image.\n",
      "- CSS border properties managed through `DOMWidget`'s methods `get_css()` and `set_css()`.\n",
      "- Image is class property, src is the traitlet synchronized\n",
      "- Canvas events propagated to Python side:\n",
      "    - Capture mouse wheel/scroll [events](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10313142/javascript-capture-mouse-wheel-event-and-do-not-scroll-the-page)\n",

      "    - mouse coordinate [awesome example](http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/advanced/html5-canvas-mouse-coordinates/)\n",
      "- All mouse events are to carry similar information.\n",
      "- Receive mouse event on Python side.\n",
      "- Interpret mouse down/up as click event on Python side.  May require explicitly registering event handler in Python.\n",
