# Canvas Image Widget for IPython Notebook

## Features

- Accept image data from Numpy arrays or URLs.
- Support Python callback functions for front-end mouse events.
- Support Canvas affine transform operations (work in progress)


## Installation

This widget uses [jupyter-pip](https://github.com/jdfreder/jupyter-pip) which allows me to make this package pip installable!  `jupyter-pip` is specifically designed to solve the distribution problem for notebook extensions that have associated JavaScript.  `jupyter-pip` takes care of placing files in all the right places.  No extra action required by the casual user, just install like any other Python package:

```bash
pip install ipynb_widget_canvas
```

## Dependencies

- `imageio`
- `requests`
- `numpy`
- `ipython`

The [`imageio`](http://imageio.github.io/) package is used to encode image data in the Python back-end prior to sending it to the browser front-end.  The `requests` package is used for fetching image data from remote URLs.

Development was done with Python 3.4 and IPython 3.2.0.

# Example Widget Usage

```py
    # Setup.
    import IPython
    import imageio  # See imageio package details at pypi.python.org/pypi/imageio

    from widget_canvas import CanvasImage

    data_image = imageio.imread('images/Whippet.jpg')

    print(data_image.dtype)
    print(data_image.shape)

    uint8
    (220, 320, 3)
```

## Display image widget

Widget properties `width` and `height` allow for direct manipulation displayed image size, independent of source data size.


```py
    # Instantiate a widget and display it.
    wid_canvas = CanvasImage(data_image)

    wid_canvas
```


    # Widget size, data size
    print((wid_canvas.height, wid_canvas.width))
    print(wid_canvas.data.shape)

    (220, 320)
    (220, 320, 3)



    # Execute this cell a few time to make the image larger...
    wid_canvas.width *= 1.2
    wid_canvas.height *= 1.2

## Mouse event handler


    # Build an event handler function.
    def simple_handler(wid, info):
        msg = 'Click: {:3d}, {:3d}'.format(info['canvasX'], info['canvasY'])
        print(msg)


    # Attach the handler to on_click events.
    wid_canvas.on_click(simple_handler)
